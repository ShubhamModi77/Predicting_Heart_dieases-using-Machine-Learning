# Predicting_Heart_dieases-using-Machine-Learning
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease? • In this project we will find accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept. • So, we used Classification algorithm of supervised learning. Also, the data was visualized in the form of graphs, using python libraries
